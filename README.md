# Scripts4BridgeIC
-----------------------------------
This area is filled with scripts written to assist Bridge Implementations Consultant's with certain tasks, such as historical data migrations, retrieving Bridge IDs with unique IDs, etc...

I will try to maintain a list of scripts on this readme with notes on their function but please check the script comments for more information and feel free to message me for more information, @swagsilewski on Slack or via email at swasilewski@instructure.com

-createEnrollments.rb
  This script takes a CSV file and adds the users therein to the courses specified. The CSV file requires two columns: One  with header UserID for the learner ID and one with the header CourseID for the course ID that that user should be enrolled in.

  This script takes a CSV file and adds the specified users, courses, scores and completed date and adds them to an instance.   The CSV file must be arranged into columns that are labeled 
    bridgeuserid: for the user id
